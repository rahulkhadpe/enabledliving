I have described below brief flow for agency users and first party of property managment.

Complex part we will take up once we finish this.

Brief structure for Agency and its users:
1. We will have admin login to the system
2. Admin will add Agencies/with its details into the system    ( every agency will have Id)
3. Agency User Regisistration Page
    There will be Agency USers ( Employees of an Agency/ Clients / Caregivers etc ) 
    In User Registration page, drop of Agencies and Roles will be there.
    Roles can be admin/manager/assistant/Clients/Caregiver/ClientFamily/Conserver etc. ( We need one UI in system to create roles )
    Based on the rols, we will take additional details as below
4.     Clients Details
    When we register Clients (from user registration page- point 3), 
    we will store additional details like Diagnosis, medications etc.
5. Caregiver Details        
    when we register Caregiver (from same form of user registration)
    we will store additional details like languages,special skills etc
6. Client Family 
    When someone from client's family regsiters, we need to select client/clients associated to family.
7. Conserver
    When we have a user as conserver, we need to select client/clients associated to conserver
8. Caregiver - Clients assocation
    At any point, person from agency will have rights to assign caregivers to clients.

Property Management
1. Registration for Property owner -
   Collect all its details and its type - whether property management company/individual home owner etc
2. Property Details
   Property owner can add number of properties and we need to enter details of each property inclusing number of rooms etc.
